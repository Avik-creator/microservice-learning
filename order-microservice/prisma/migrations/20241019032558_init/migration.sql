  Warnings:

  - You are about to drop the column `createdAt` on the `OrderItem` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the column `updatedAt` on the `OrderItem` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - You are about to drop the `_OrderToOrderItem` table. If the table is not empty, all the data it contains will be lost.
  - Changed the type of `status` on the `Order` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
